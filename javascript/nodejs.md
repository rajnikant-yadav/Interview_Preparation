# Node.js <br>
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!

Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.

A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.

This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.

Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.

In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.

## Key features of Node.js include:<br>
#### JavaScript on the Server Side:
Node.js enables the use of JavaScript on the server side, providing a unified language for both server-side and client-side development.<br>

#### Asynchronous and Event-Driven:
Node.js is built on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it well-suited for handling concurrent operations. This allows for efficient handling of many connections simultaneously.<br>

#### Fast Execution:
It uses the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, developed by Google, which compiles JavaScript code to native machine code, providing high performance.<br>

### NPM (Node Package Manager):
Node.js comes with npm, a package manager that allows developers to easily install and manage third-party libraries and packages for their projects.<br>

#### Scalability:
Node.js is designed to be scalable and is particularly suitable for building real-time applications like chat applications, online gaming, and collaborative tools.<br>

#### Large Ecosystem:
Node.js has a vibrant and active ecosystem with a large number of libraries and frameworks available for various purposes, making development faster and more efficient.<br>

#### Cross-Platform:
Node.js is cross-platform and can be installed on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Here's a simple example of a basic HTTP server using Node.js:<br>
```javascript
// Import the HTTP module
const http = require('http');

// Configure the HTTP server to respond with "Hello, World!" to all requests
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

// Listen on port 3000 and IP address 127.0.0.1
server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
});
```

## Thread
In computing, a thread refers to the smallest unit of execution within a process. A thread is a sequence of instructions that can be scheduled and executed independently by a computer's operating system. Multiple threads within a single process share the same resources, such as memory space, but they run independently.<br>

## Here are some key points about threads:
#### Lightweight:
Threads are lightweight compared to processes, as they share the same memory space and resources. This makes context switching between threads less expensive than switching between processes.<br>

#### Independent execution:
Threads can run independently within a process, meaning they can execute instructions simultaneously. However, they may need to synchronize access to shared resources to avoid conflicts.<br>

#### Preemption:
Threads can be preempted by the operating system scheduler, allowing other threads to run. This ensures that all threads have a fair share of CPU time and prevents any single thread from monopolizing the CPU.<br>

#### Communication:
Threads can communicate with each other using various mechanisms, such as shared variables, message passing, and inter-thread synchronization primitives.<br>

Single-threaded programs execute instructions in a sequential manner, one after the other. In contrast, multithreaded programs can execute multiple threads concurrently, taking advantage of multiple CPU cores to improve performance and responsiveness.<br><br>

## Single Threading:
Single threading refers to the execution of a program using only one thread. In simpler terms, the program runs one set of instructions at a time, and tasks are completed sequentially. If one task is ongoing, the program waits for it to finish before moving on to the next task.<br><br>

## Multi-Threading:
Multi-threading involves the simultaneous execution of multiple threads within a program. Each thread can run its set of instructions independently, allowing for parallel processing. This means that different tasks can be performed concurrently, potentially improving the overall performance and responsiveness of the program.<br><br>

## Thread Pool:
A thread pool is a pool of worker threads that are created in advance and kept ready to perform tasks. Instead of creating a new thread for each individual task, a thread pool allows you to reuse existing threads, reducing the overhead associated with thread creation and destruction.<br><br>

## Event Queue:
The event queue is a data structure that holds events or tasks that are produced by the application or the runtime environment. These events typically include things like incoming requests, completed I/O operations, or timers that have expired. The event queue acts as a waiting area for events that need to be processed.

When an asynchronous operation is initiated (like reading from a file or making a network request), it doesn't block the execution of the program. Instead, a corresponding event is placed in the event queue. The event loop continually checks the event queue, and when it finds an event, it processes it by executing the associated callback or task.<br><br>

## Event Loop:
The event loop is a core concept in Node.js, and it's what allows Node.js to handle multiple operations concurrently. It's a loop that constantly checks if there are any tasks in the event queue that need attention. The event loop efficiently manages the execution of these tasks, ensuring that your program remains responsive to new events or requests.<br><br>

## How Node.js Work
**When a user sends a request to a Node.js server, the following happens:**

The request is placed in a queue called the event queue.<br>
The event loop is a single thread that monitors the event queue for new requests.<br>
When a new request is detected, the event loop removes it from the queue and assigns it to a worker thread.<br>
The worker thread processes the request and sends a response back to the event loop.<br>
The event loop then places the response in a queue called the callback queue.<br>
The event loop then continues monitoring the event queue for new requests.<br>
When the event loop detects that there is a response in the callback queue, it sends it back to the client.<br>
This process is repeated continuously, allowing Node.js to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking.<br>

In the case of continuous requests, the event loop will simply continue to assign the requests to worker threads as they are received. This means that the server can continue to handle new requests even if there are already requests being processed.<br>

**Here is a simplified explanation of how the internal mechanism of Node.js works when a user sends continuous requests:**
The user sends a request to the Node.js server.<br>
The request is placed in the event queue.<br>
The event loop detects the new request and assigns it to a worker thread.<br>
The worker thread starts processing the request.<br>
The user sends another request to the server.<br>
The second request is also placed in the event queue.<br>
The event loop detects the second request and assigns it to another worker thread.<br>
The worker threads continue to process the requests concurrently.<br>
When a worker thread finishes processing a request, it sends a response back to the event loop.<br>
The event loop places the response in the callback queue.<br>
The event loop then sends the response back to the user.<br>
The process repeats itself as long as the user continues to send requests.<br>
Node.js is able to handle continuous requests efficiently because it uses a non-blocking I/O model. This means that the worker threads do not have to wait for I/O operations (such as reading from a file or writing to a database) to complete before they can continue processing the request.<br>

As a result, Node.js servers can handle a large number of concurrent requests without blocking. This is one of the reasons why Node.js is well-suited for building real-time applications.
