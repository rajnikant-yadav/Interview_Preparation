## Synchronous and Asynchronous Operation
Synchronous and asynchronous operations refer to the way in which tasks or operations are executed in a program, particularly in the context of handling time-consuming or non-blocking tasks like I/O operations, network requests, or file system operations.

### Synchronous Operation:
In synchronous programming, tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other, in the order they appear. Each task must complete before the next one starts. The program waits for each operation to finish before moving on to the next one.

```javascript
console.log("Start");

// Synchronous operation (blocks until complete)
const result = someFunctionSync();
console.log(result);

console.log("End");
