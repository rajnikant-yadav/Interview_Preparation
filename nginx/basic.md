# NGINX

Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a popular open-source web server, reverse proxy server, and load balancer. It is well-known for its performance, stability, and scalability. Originally created to solve the C10k problem (handling 10,000 simultaneous connections), Nginx has since gained widespread adoption and is used by many large-scale websites and applications.

## Key features of Nginx include:

**Web Server:** Nginx can serve static content such as HTML, CSS, and images. Its design makes it efficient at handling a large number of simultaneous connections and requests.

**Reverse Proxy:** Nginx can act as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests from clients to other servers (e.g., application servers, microservices). This helps improve security, scalability, and performance.

**Load Balancer:** Nginx can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed, improving overall system reliability and performance.

**HTTP Server and Proxy Server:** Nginx supports the HTTP and HTTPS protocols, making it suitable for hosting websites and web applications. It can also act as a proxy server for various protocols, not limited to HTTP.

**TLS/SSL Termination:** Nginx can handle SSL/TLS termination, offloading the encryption and decryption process from application servers. This helps in reducing the load on backend servers.

**High Performance:** Nginx is designed for high performance and low resource usage. It can handle a large number of concurrent connections and deliver static content efficiently.

**Configuration Flexibility:** Nginx provides a flexible configuration syntax, allowing administrators to tailor its behavior to suit specific needs.

Nginx is commonly used in conjunction with other web technologies like PHP, Python, Ruby, and more. It has become a popular choice for serving web content and managing web traffic due to its speed, efficiency, and versatility.
