# Elastic Stack
The Elastic Stack, formerly known as the ELK Stack, is a set of open-source tools designed for searching, analyzing, and visualizing data in real-time. The Elastic Stack is widely used for log and event data analysis, monitoring, and business intelligence. The stack consists of several components, each serving a specific purpose. The major components include:

## Elasticsearch:
Purpose: A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.
Key Features:
Full-text search capabilities.
Real-time indexing and searching of large datasets.
Support for structured and unstructured data.
Distributed architecture for scalability.

## Logstash:
Purpose: A server-side data processing pipeline that ingests, transforms, and sends data to Elasticsearch.
Key Features:
Collects and processes log and event data from various sources.
Supports various input sources (logs, databases, etc.).
Enables data enrichment and transformation.
Outputs data to various destinations, often Elasticsearch.

## Kibana:
Purpose: A web-based user interface for visualizing and exploring data stored in Elasticsearch.
Key Features:
Data visualization through charts, graphs, and dashboards.
Real-time monitoring and analytics.
Interactive exploration of data.
Dashboard creation and sharing.

## Beats:
Purpose: Lightweight data shippers for sending data to Elasticsearch or Logstash.
Key Features:
Collects and ships different types of data (logs, metrics, etc.).
Minimal resource footprint.
Various Beat modules for specific data types (Filebeat for log files, Metricbeat for metrics, etc.).
Can be used for centralized log collection.

### The Elastic Stack is commonly used for various use cases, including:

**Log Analysis:** Centralized logging and analysis of log data from multiple sources.

**Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of infrastructure and applications.

**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Analyzing security events and logs for threat detection.

**Business Intelligence:** Analyzing and visualizing business data for decision-making.

The Elastic Stack is highly flexible and can be adapted to different scenarios and data types, making it a popular choice for organizations dealing with large volumes of data that require real-time analysis and visualization.
