# Elastic Stack
The Elastic Stack, formerly known as the ELK Stack, is a set of open-source tools designed for searching, analyzing, and visualizing data in real-time. The Elastic Stack is widely used for log and event data analysis, monitoring, and business intelligence. The stack consists of several components, each serving a specific purpose. The major components include:<br>

#### Elasticsearch:
Purpose: A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.
Key Features:
Full-text search capabilities.
Real-time indexing and searching of large datasets.
Support for structured and unstructured data.
Distributed architecture for scalability.<br>

#### Logstash:
Purpose: A server-side data processing pipeline that ingests, transforms, and sends data to Elasticsearch.
Key Features:
Collects and processes log and event data from various sources.
Supports various input sources (logs, databases, etc.).
Enables data enrichment and transformation.
Outputs data to various destinations, often Elasticsearch.<br>

#### Kibana:
Purpose: A web-based user interface for visualizing and exploring data stored in Elasticsearch.
Key Features:
Data visualization through charts, graphs, and dashboards.
Real-time monitoring and analytics.
Interactive exploration of data.
Dashboard creation and sharing.<br>

#### Beats:
Purpose: Lightweight data shippers for sending data to Elasticsearch or Logstash.
Key Features:
Collects and ships different types of data (logs, metrics, etc.).
Minimal resource footprint.
Various Beat modules for specific data types (Filebeat for log files, Metricbeat for metrics, etc.).
Can be used for centralized log collection.<br>

#### The Elastic Stack is commonly used for various use cases, including:

**Log Analysis:** Centralized logging and analysis of log data from multiple sources.

**Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of infrastructure and applications.

**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Analyzing security events and logs for threat detection.

**Business Intelligence:** Analyzing and visualizing business data for decision-making.

The Elastic Stack is highly flexible and can be adapted to different scenarios and data types, making it a popular choice for organizations dealing with large volumes of data that require real-time analysis and visualization.<br>

## ElasticSearch Cluster:
In Elasticsearch, a cluster is a collection of one or more nodes (servers) that work together to store and manage data. The cluster provides scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability for the stored data. Key points about Elasticsearch clusters include:<br>

#### Nodes: 
Nodes are individual instances of Elasticsearch running on servers. Each node in a cluster stores a part of the data and serves as a processing unit.<br>

#### Data Distribution: 
The data in an Elasticsearch cluster is distributed across multiple nodes. This distribution is automatic, and each node is responsible for a specific subset of the data. This horizontal distribution allows Elasticsearch to scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster.<br>

#### Fault Tolerance: 
Elasticsearch provides fault tolerance by replicating data across multiple nodes. If one node fails, the data is still available on other nodes. This replication also improves read performance by allowing multiple nodes to serve read requests.<br>

#### Master Node: 
In a cluster, one node is elected as the master node, which is responsible for cluster-wide management tasks, such as creating or deleting indices and handling node additions or removals.

#### Index: 
An index in Elasticsearch is a collection of documents with similar characteristics. Each document represents a piece of data, and an index is divided into shards, which are the basic units of data distribution.<br>

#### Sharding: 
Sharding involves breaking an index into smaller pieces called shards and distributing them across different nodes in the cluster. Sharding allows Elasticsearch to distribute data and queries across multiple nodes, enhancing both performance and scalability.

In summary, an Elasticsearch cluster is a distributed and scalable system that enables efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of large volumes of data. It provides fault tolerance, high availability, and the ability to scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster.
