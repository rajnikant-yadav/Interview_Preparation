# Puppeteer
Puppeteer is a Node.js library developed by Google that provides a high-level API over the Chrome DevTools Protocol. It is primarily used for automating web browsers (specifically, the Chrome and Chromium browsers) for tasks such as web scraping, taking screenshots, generating PDFs, testing websites, and automating interactions with web pages.

With Puppeteer, you can control a headless or full version of a Chromium browser, allowing you to navigate web pages, interact with elements on the page, and extract data. It is particularly useful for tasks that involve user interactions, as Puppeteer can simulate user input like clicks, form submissions, and keyboard input.

## Here are some common use cases for Puppeteer
#### Web Scraping:
Automating the extraction of data from websites.

#### Taking Screenshots and Generating PDFs: 
Capturing screenshots or generating PDFs of web pages.
```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://www.example.com');
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' });
  await browser.close();
})();
```
#### Automated Testing: 
Running tests on web applications by automating browser interactions.

#### Headless Browsing: 
Running a browser in the background without a graphical user interface, useful for server-side tasks.

## What is a Headless Browser?
A headless browser is a regular browser, except that we cannot see anything on the screen. The program runs in the backend i.e., it's not visible, but it still has functionality. Thus, it's sometimes known as a "headless" or "headless browser."

A headless browser can perform all the functions of clicking links, uploading and downloading documents, and navigating pages by executing our program's instructions. When we use a normal browser, we see each step of the program in a GUI presentation. But when we use a headless browser, all steps of the program are carried out sequentially and correctly, and we can track it with the help of a console or command-line interface.
